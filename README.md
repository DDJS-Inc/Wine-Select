Wine Select

1. A wine website that helps you decide which wine to choose.

2. It solves the issue of finding which wine pairs with the dinner you are having as well as giving you details about the wine. The details provided will be the year of the wine, the vineyard it was made as well as how the wine tastes. We know it can be overwhelming trying to find the right wine especially when there are so many to select from. Here at Wine Select, we make sure you have an easier time finding which wine is best for you.

3. A website that has a homepage with a nice hero image on the front as well as a nav bar that brings you to our different pages. One page that helps you pair food with wine with user interaction. A page with information about different wines and you can click on those that give you further details about that specific bottle. We will have all main types of wine
